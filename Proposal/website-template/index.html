<p>In ancient mythology, the solar eclipse was believed to be a celestial dance between two powerful gods: the Sun God named Helios and the Moon God named Deimos. According to the legend, the Sun God, radiant and mighty, traverses the sky each day, bringing warmth and light to the world. He is revered as the symbol of strength, vitality, and life itself. Helios is the god of the sun and the reason we see it as a moving ball of pure light instead of how the solar system see it as us rotating it like a follower to a boss. Helios is nothing but positive energy and it knows that a looming threat is always around him. In rare times, Helios has admitted defeat to his evil counterpart in a battle only gods and angels can witness. 

Opposite to the Sun God is the Moon God, mysterious and enigmatic. He rules the night sky, casting his gentle silver glow over the land. The Moon God represents wisdom, intuition, and the unseen realms of the subconscious. Deimos is the god of the moon and plans to add other moons to his army of darkness. He is pure evil and needs all the power of moons and gloominess to succeed in taking over earth realm and then maybe more but that is just a theory among people who studied this history, including myself. He may be the younger of the 2 gods, but he knows that one day, the sun god will meet its demise, or they both will. It is the ultimate ultimatum between both gods and follower of both believe if one of the gods dies, their followers would as well. One small thing though, only a few people know the secret that both godly beings need to be alive for the world to be balanced or else the universe would be thrown out of its place.  

The solar eclipse is interpreted as a rare moment of cosmic confrontation between these two deities. As the Moon God passes in front of the Sun God, temporarily blocking his brilliant light, it is seen as a symbolic battle or embrace between opposing forces. Some ancient cultures believed that during the eclipse, the Moon God briefly gains dominion over the world, symbolizing a shift in power from day to night. Others saw it as a union between the two gods, representing harmony and balance in the cosmos. This battle has been going on since the dawn of the solar system and will never end until one wins, or they both die in a bang. 

Devotees of the Sun God would perform rituals and offerings during the eclipse to ensure his victory and continued blessings upon the Earth. Followers of the Moon God, on the other hand, might view the eclipse as a time of heightened spiritual connection and introspection, embracing the darkness as a source of wisdom and renewal. Throughout history, solar eclipses have been seen 2 to 5 times a year but are viewed in various places on earth. Many hidden videos are here on this website that link messages from Deimos and a heavenly warning from Helios.  

The solar eclipse was seen not only as a celestial phenomenon but also as a profound symbol of the eternal interplay between light and darkness, day and night, and the divine forces that govern the universe. There is a 30 second clip that sums up why they battle every solar eclipse and what would happen if the other side won the infinity war. Every day, the world gets a bit eviler and crazier due to the followers of the moon god ordering them to being havoc and chaos in the world, fueling his power increasingly as the days pass us by. May gods have mercy on us all. </p>
